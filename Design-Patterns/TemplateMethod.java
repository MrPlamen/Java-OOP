/*The design pattern in which an abstract class declares an abstract method that must be implemented by concrete subclasses 
is known as the "Template Method" design pattern.

Concrete subclasses of Book are expected to provide their own implementations of the method 'SetTitle' to customize the behavior for setting the title field.*/

abstract class Book{

    String title;

    abstract void setTitle(String s);

    String getTitle(){
        return title;
    }
}
